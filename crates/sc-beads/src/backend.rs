//! The beads backend contract.
//!
//! [`BeadsBackend`] is transport-neutral: a future SQL or `DoltHub` transport
//! implements it alone. Everything transport- or backend-specific is reached
//! through optional accessors ([`BeadsBackend::cli`], [`BeadsBackend::dolt`],
//! [`BeadsBackend::close_suggestions`]) that default to `None`, so callers hold an
//! `Arc<dyn BeadsBackend>` and never downcast. All traits are object-safe and
//! `Send + Sync`, and synchronous (calls block for the child's lifetime, as today).
//!
//! Source citations (`file:line`) refer to the pre-split app sources at `a18c724`.
